Vanilla JS Simple Clock
This is a simple web application that displays the current time using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It uses the Date object to get the current time, and updates the display every second using the setInterval function. It also uses some basic CSS properties to style the clock and make it responsive.
